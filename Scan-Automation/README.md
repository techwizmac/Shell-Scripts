Scan Automation

Simple script to automate usage of some basic scan tools.
it requires a file called host to be created and containing the IP/host name of the target.
Wehn the script it run, it will create a text file called Scan-Result to dump results of scan process
depending on what was selected.

Subsequent iterations of this tool should make the list of tools more extensive  and be able to indicate which tools
to run and which ones not to.
Eventually I am planning to move this to a PYthon based tool.
